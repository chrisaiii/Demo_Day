                  <p>During the beginning of the 2023 year, I found out about an organization called "All Star Code". I was deeply interested in computer science so I applied and eventually got in. With my time at All Star Code, I have learned so much that I had not known before and it has taught me to look at coding in many different ways. From the people I have met to the projects I have built, this is one of my biggest achievements.</p>
